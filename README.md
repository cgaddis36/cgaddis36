- Currently Learning: React Native, React, iOS development
- Well-rounded in: Ruby, GraphQL, PostgresQL, API construction, extraction & configuration
Current Personal Project: ShoreCast
Mobile Application designed to help recreational boaters, divers, fisherman and beachgoers plan their days on the water in one centralized location.
3 Main Goals: 1) Provide NOAA tides predictions charts after entering in your zipcode
              2) On the same Page display your next 72 Hour hourly weather forecast as well as the next 7 day weather forecast summary for AM and PM pulled                  from the National Weather Service API.
              3) Provide a custom database to hold information for all Bait Shops, fly Shops and fishing/hunting guides in the area. Users can then go rate                  these services for each business. Ratings for different services at each business are kept separately through a many-to-many relationship                  on the BusinessService tables.
Future Iterations: 
        - Provide a map for the sonar weather forecast for the day.
        - Provide a profile space for users to edit their information and reviews they have recently written for Businesses and their Services.
